- Summary
  - Note: add later a brief summary of the project and github repo address (with allowed access for viewing) for member contributions _(most easily shown through commits in the repo where your project lives)_
  
- Documentation  
  - `readme.md`, includes:
    - proof of planning: pseudocode (and or flowcharts showing program logic if desired)
    - describe features of the algorithm
      - 'what input can it take in'
      - 'what is/are the output(s) you can receive back?'
      - 'why was development like this important to your group?'
    - clear, conscientious comments embedded within the your code
    - provide detailed instructions how to compile your algorithm, including:
      - how to input data
      - how to compile each/any option from your feature set
- Datasets
  - Include a mock dataset for each group memeber
  - *Note: hardcoding datasets is allowed as the use of databases is not required/desired for this project.*
- Use only what you know from CSC 211
- Required Structures
  - At least one `Class` structure
  - Use `vectors` over `arrays`
